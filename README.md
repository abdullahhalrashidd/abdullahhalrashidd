## 🚀 A Little About Me  
I’m a third year Computer Systems Engineering student @ Carleton University passionate about building innovative and unique software to solve real-world problems.  

💻 I enjoy learning about:  
- Industry standard tools like CUDA (currently learning), Github, PyTorch
- New and innovative advances in the technological space (i.e. Deployment of AI Datacenters via Starcloud to space as a cooling solution)
